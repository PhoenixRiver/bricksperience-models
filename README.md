# bricksperience-models

Models in ldr and Bricksperience format for importing or just plain copying into Bricksperience.

Only the Bricksperience sav file is stored here since it is only a small binary and the screenshots are large ones that can be recreated by the user with the inbuilt editor if they want.

Check the last commit comment for whether the file is a perfect reproduction or if the ldr had to be changed to accomodate missing bricks (see "missing_bricks.txt" for an ordered list of brick numbers that are missing from Bricksperience but available in Stud.io / LDraw).


NOTE: As per the author's request, all models have their minifigs (and held objects) removed from ldr files and bricks with images or stickers are swapped for their blank versions as Bricksperience has none of these due to the bloat it would cause for little benefit since most are only used for very few models.


PostScript: If anyone has contact with the author of the indiedb models I can add in the bs-format ones (though I don't have the ldr's they were created from, of course, so attribution would be hard to source?)
