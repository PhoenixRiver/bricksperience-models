# bricksperience-models

Models in ldr and Bricksperience format for importing or just plain copying into Bricksperience.

Only the Bricksperience sav file is stored here since it is only a small binary and the screenshots are large ones that can be recreated by the user with the inbuilt editor if they want.

Check the last commit comment for whether the file is a perfect reproduction or if the ldr had to be changed to accomodate missing bricks (see "missing_bricks.txt" for an ordered list of brick numbers that are missing from Bricksperience but available in Stud.io / LDraw).


NOTE: As per the author's request, all models have their minifigs (and held objects) removed from ldr files and bricks with images or stickers are swapped for their blank versions as Bricksperience has none of these due to the bloat it would cause for little benefit since most are only used for very few models. As a Classic Space fan where this is almost entirely not the case (there are very few varients of the standard bricks printed for Classic Space and thos that exist are constantly reused) who has accepted that the author is at liberty to do as they like with their creation don't argue with me on this... especially when it comes to "insert copyrighted franchise name here" and their novelty, special edition printed pieces, minifigs and random, odd bricks that are only ever used in one set.\<end rant\> ;) :D


PostScript: If anyone has contact with the author of the indiedb models I can add in the bs-format ones (though I don't have the ldr's they were created from, of course, so attribution would be hard to source?)


PPS: For avoidance of doubt, I apologise entirely if anything in this archive contravenes any laws anywhere they might apply, the only work I have added to any of the files here (other than maintaining this git) is convertin gthe original files into ldr format and then potentially editting those to clean them and swap alternative bricks into them as necessary to successfully import them into the inbuilt bs editor using that to add an built order and one or two pieces of various metadata that was missing from the original files to create bs format files that have then been placed here for other fans. Please contact me if you think for any reason this stuff needs to be taken down and I will act as promptly as possibly to do so.
